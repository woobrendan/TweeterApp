App uses AJAX to insert newly created posts to the top of the feed without having to refresh the page. The page will also dynamically change depending on the viewport of the user, supporting smaller tablet sized screens or desktop screens.

The app also highlights a tweet on hover and keeps track of how many characters are left for your tweet! It has responsive design to meet the requirements of the users device, adjusting to fit accordingly.
